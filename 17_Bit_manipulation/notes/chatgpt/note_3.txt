No problem — I will explain **1’s complement ON PAPER vs IN CODE** with a **very simple and different method** so you will understand 100%.

---

# ⭐ **Think like this:**

There are **two worlds**:

---

# 🌍 **WORLD 1 → ON PAPER (Simple Binary World)**

Here, numbers have **ONLY the bits you write**.

### Rule:

👉 Just flip the bits
0 → 1
1 → 0

### Example:

Number = **5**

Write 5 in 4-bit binary (we choose 4 bits just to show example):

```
5 = 0101
```

Flip bits:

```
1's complement = 1010
```

So in this world:

```
1's complement of 5 = 1010 (binary) = 10 (decimal)
```

✔ Very simple
✔ No negative numbers
✔ No 32-bit storage
✔ Just bit flipping

---

# 🖥 **WORLD 2 → IN CODE (Java or any language)**

Here, numbers are stored in **32 bits always** (fixed size).
Even for small numbers like 5.

So Java does NOT flip only 4 bits.
Java flips **all 32 bits** of the number.

---

# ⭐ Let's see step by step

### Step 1 — Write 5 in **32 bits**

```
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000101
```

### Step 2 — Apply ~ (NOT) → Flip all 32 bits

```
11111111 11111111 11111111 11111010
```

Now the result is a **negative number** because the first bit is 1.

---

# ⭐ VERY SIMPLE WAY TO FIND ITS DECIMAL VALUE

### Step 3 — Convert to decimal

To find the value of this negative number:

### Rule:

1. Take 1's complement
2. Add 1
3. Put minus sign

---

### Step 3.1 — 1’s Complement

Flip again:

```
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000101
```

### Step 3.2 — Add 1

```
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000110 = 6
```

### Step 3.3 — Put negative sign

```
= -6
```

So:

```
~5 = -6
```

# ⭐ SUPER SIMPLE DIFFERENCE (Final)

| Where?           | What happens?                | Result for 5                     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **On Paper**     | Flip only the bits you write | 0101 → 1010 = **10**             |
| **In Java Code** | Flips all **32 bits**        | 000...0101 → 111...1010 = **-6** |

# ⭐ One More Easy Explanation (Using Boxes)

## On Paper:

* You have **4 boxes**
* You flip only 4 boxes

```
0101 → 1010
```

## In Java:

* You have **32 boxes**
* Java flips **ALL 32 boxes**

```
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000101
↓ flip all 32 bits
11111111 11111111 11111111 11111010 = -6
```

More boxes = different answer.

# ⭐ Java Code to Show It

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(~5);  // -6
    }
}
```
