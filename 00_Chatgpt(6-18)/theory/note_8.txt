Here is **PURE THEORY ONLY** (no code, no examples), covering **Strings in Java**, their **properties**, and **methods** from **basic → deep**.

---

# 🟦 **STRINGS IN JAVA — COMPLETE THEORY**

## **1. Definition**

A String in Java is a **sequence of characters** represented as an object of the `String` class.
Unlike many languages where strings are primitive, Java treats Strings as **immutable objects** stored in the heap.

---

## **2. Memory Behavior (Deep Theory)**

### **2.1 Immutable Nature**

Once a String object is created, **its value cannot be changed**.
Any modification produces a **new String object**.

### **2.2 String Constant Pool (SCP)**

Java maintains a special memory region called **String Pool**, where literal strings are stored.

Rules:

* Duplicate literals are not created; reference is reused.
* Immutable nature enables pooling, saving memory and improving performance.

### **2.3 Heap Memory**

Strings created using constructors or new operations are stored in the **heap**, not the pool.

### **2.4 Why Strings Are Immutable**

* Security (class names, passwords, URLs)
* Thread-safety
* HashCode caching
* Memory optimization through pooling

---

## **3. Important Properties of Strings**

### **3.1 Immutable**

Cannot be altered once created.

### **3.2 Stored as Objects**

String is a **reference type**, not primitive.

### **3.3 Interning**

SCP uses interning to avoid duplicates.

### **3.4 Comparable**

Strings implement **Comparable**, enabling lexicographical comparison.

### **3.5 Length Fixed After Creation**

Once created, the sequence length does not change.

### **3.6 Unicode-Based**

Java Strings internally use Unicode, supporting all languages and symbols.

### **3.7 Backed by a Character Array**

String value is internally stored using an array-like structure (conceptually char[]).

---

# 🟦 **STRING METHODS — THEORETICAL PURPOSE & BEHAVIOR**

No examples — only descriptions.

---

## 🔹 **1. length()**

Returns the number of characters in the string.
Does not count memory size; counts Unicode code units.

---

## 🔹 **2. charAt()**

Retrieves the character at a specific index.
Uses zero-based indexing.

---

## 🔹 **3. substring()**

Extracts a portion of the string.
Always returns a **new string** due to immutability.

---

## 🔹 **4. equals()**

Compares string **content**, not memory reference.

---

## 🔹 **5. equalsIgnoreCase()**

Compares content while ignoring case differences.

---

## 🔹 **6. compareTo()**

Performs **lexicographical comparison** (dictionary order) using Unicode values.

---

## 🔹 **7. startsWith()**

Checks if the string begins with a specific prefix.

---

## 🔹 **8. endsWith()**

Checks if the string ends with a specific suffix.

---

## 🔹 **9. contains()**

Checks if a subsequence of characters exists within the string.

---

## 🔹 **10. indexOf()**

Returns the index of the first occurrence of a character or substring.

---

## 🔹 **11. lastIndexOf()**

Returns the index of the last occurrence.

---

## 🔹 **12. toUpperCase()**

Converts characters to uppercase using locale rules.

---

## 🔹 **13. toLowerCase()**

Converts characters to lowercase.

---

## 🔹 **14. trim()**

Removes leading and trailing whitespace, not the internal spaces.

---

## 🔹 **15. replace()**

Returns a new string where particular characters or sequences are substituted.

---

## 🔹 **16. split()**

Divides the string into parts using a delimiter, producing an array of strings.

---

## 🔹 **17. join()**

Joins multiple strings using a delimiter.

---

## 🔹 **18. concat()**

Appends another string — creates a new object.

---

## 🔹 **19. isEmpty()**

Checks if length = 0.

---

## 🔹 **20. isBlank()**

Checks if the string contains only whitespace or is empty.

---

# 🟦 **DEEP ADDITIONAL STRING CONCEPTS**

## **A. Mutable String Alternatives**

Since String is immutable, Java provides:

* **StringBuilder** → mutable + not thread-safe
* **StringBuffer** → mutable + thread-safe

They modify internal character arrays without creating new objects.

---

## **B. HashCode Behavior**

String hashcode is computed from characters and stored for reuse.
Immutability ensures hash stays consistent, which is crucial for HashMap keys.

---

## **C. String Interning Theory**

Interning stores one copy of each distinct literal.
Benefits:

* Saves memory
* Faster comparison (reference-based)

---

# 🟦 SUMMARY (PURE THEORY)

* Strings are immutable objects stored in heap or SCP.
* SCP avoids duplicates using interning.
* String methods always return *new objects*.
* Mutable alternatives exist for performance-critical tasks.
* Strings use Unicode and are internally sequence-based.

If you want, I can now explain **StringBuilder Theory**, **StringBuffer Theory**, or **String Algorithms Theory** (Palindrome, Reverse, Anagram, Sliding Window on Strings).
